# **OLC Research: Octonionic Lattice Cryptography**

**Post-Quantum Cryptography based on Non-Associative Algebra and Topological Impedance.**

This repository contains the reference implementations for cryptographic primitives derived using non-associative arithmetic. Unlike standard cryptographic systems that rely on the hardness of factoring or discrete logarithms in associative groups (RSA, ECC), these primitives derive their security from the **Associator Hazard** found in the algebra of Octonions.

## **Core Primitives**

### **1\. The Synergeia VDF (Verifiable Delay Function)**

**Status:** Working Prototype | **File:** src/vdf.rs

The **Synergeia VDF** is the world's first VDF construction to explicitly leverage non-associativity as a barrier to parallelization.

* **The Problem:** Standard algebraic iterations like fail in alternative algebras due to **Artin's Theorem**, which confines the trajectory to an associative subalgebra (making it trivial to parallelize).  
* **The Solution:** Synergeia introduces **Rotational Injection** to break Artin's Theorem. By injecting a third independent generator at every step, the trajectory is forced into the non-associative bulk of the 8-dimensional manifold.   
* **Performance:** Benchmarks confirm **strict sequentiality**. Parallel attacks with multiple threads achieve zero speedup (no advantage).  
* **Arithmetic:** Pure u64 integer arithmetic, strictly deterministic.

### **2\. The Flutter Engine (IoT Stream Cipher & HD Wallet)**

**Status:** Working Prototype | **File:** src/main.rs, src/fltCipher.rs

**Flutter** is a lightweight, chaotic stream cipher designed for low-power IoT devices. It simulates the "Vacuum Flutter Epoch" of the early universe.

* **Architecture:** **Bi-Octonion State** (256-bit entropy). Two coupled octonions evolve via a chaotic map.  
* **Features:**  
  * **HD Wallet:** Uses the Flutter engine as a Key Derivation Function (KDF) to generate deterministic keypairs from a master seed.  
  * **Signatures:** Implements a Winternitz-style ("Burst") one-time signature scheme using the chaotic trajectory.  
  * **Security:** Resistant to Grover's Algorithm.

### **3\. RS-JLWE (Real-Secret Jordan-LWE)**

**Status:** Experimental / Research | **File:** src/albert.rs

A lattice-based encryption scheme built over the **Albert Algebra**, the algebra of three-by-three Hermitian Octonionic matrices.

* **Concept:** Adapts Learning With Errors (LWE) to a non-associative setting.  
* **Innovation:** Uses "Real-Secret" keys (scalars) to ensure commutative decryption while preserving the non-associative "Jordan Associator Gap" against lattice reduction attacks.

## **Usage**

Prerequisites: Rust (Cargo).

To run the full suite of benchmarks (Flutter Wallet demo \+ Synergeia VDF benchmark):

cargo run \--release

### **Expected Output**

1. **Flutter Engine:** Derives keys, signs a message ("Octonions Rule The Vacuum"), and verifies the signature.  
2. **Synergeia VDF:**  
   * **Test 1:** Verifies the Associator Hazard is non-zero (success).  
   * **Test 2:** Runs sequential benchmark (\~1.7M ops/sec).  
   * **Test 3:** Simulates a parallel attack to prove no speedup is possible.

## **Theoretical Background**

* **Artin's Theorem:** "The subalgebra generated by any two elements in an alternative algebra is associative."  
* **Topological Impedance:** The computational cost incurred by an adversary attempting to resolve the order of operations in a non-associative expression tree without the correct bracketing key.  
* **Geometric Stiffness:** A parameter modeling the resistance of the vacuum to deformation, used here to tune the chaos of the cipher state.
